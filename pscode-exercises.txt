// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

A = even
B = odd

Input number
If (number can be divided by 2 with no decimals remaining) then print "the number is even."
Else
Print "the number is odd."

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

A) read numbers from 1 to 5 as list
Enter "number"
Read "number"
Keep "number"
Repeat with next "number"
List numbers

B) Add whole digit numbers 1 through 5 together
Read the sum
Divide the sum by "5"
Read the average

C) Read the minimum number
Read the maximum number
For each of the numbers 1 to 5 declare the smallest
For each of the numbers 1 to 5 declare the largest

D) Print "the average of the numbers 1 to 5 is: " + result
Print "the smallest of the entered numbers is: " + result
Print "the largest of the entered numbers is: " + result
